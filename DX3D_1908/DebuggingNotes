Graphics 2 - Debugging Notes

Issue:
  Lights not working at all positions.
Hypothesis:
  Directions or Normals are not being passed into the shaders correctly.
Things done to fix issue:
  In Pixel Shader:
    -dot was taking light direction instead of -lightdirection.
    -ps_in norm was wrong. showed -X rather than +Y.

**ps_in norm.w needed to be set to 0 before multing to world**
